    Investigation
  </h3>
  <p>
    We investigate selected reports of alleged acts of corruption, in particular those cases that have the most serious impact on our society. We hand our findings over to the relevant authorities to take further action, and we monitor the progress of each case. We work with mainstream and community media to make sure that corruption is fully exposed through our investigative work.
