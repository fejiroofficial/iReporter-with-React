  <div className={Classes.LearnContentTitle}>OUR DEFINITION OF CORRUPTION</div>

  <div className={Classes.LearnContentTitle}>WE ARE ALL AFFECTED</div>
  <h3>Corruption affects us all</h3>
  <p>
    Corruption affects us all. It threatens sustainable economic development, ethical values and justice; it destabilises our
    society and endangers the rule of law. It undermines the institutions and values of our democracy. But because public
    policies and public resources are largely beneficial to poor people, it is they who suffer the harmful effects of
    corruption most grievously.
  </p>
  <p>
    To be dependent on the government for housing, healthcare, education, security and welfare, makes the poor most vulnerable
    to corruption since it stalls service delivery. Delays in infrastructure development, poor building quality and layers
    of additional costs are all consequences of corruption.
  </p>
  <p>Many acts of corruption deprive our citizens of their constitutional and their human rights.</p>
  <h3>Economic implications</h3>
  <p>Corruption and international perceptions of corruption in Africa has been damaging to the continent's reputation
    and has created obstacles to local and foreign direct investment, flows to the stock market, global competitiveness,
    economic growth and has ultimately distorted the development and upliftment of our people.</p>
  <p>Public money is for government services and projects. Taxes collected, bonds issued, income from government investments
    and other means of financing government expenditure are meant for social grants, education, hospitals, roads, the
    supply of power and water and to ensure the personal security of our citizens.</p>
  <p>Corruption and bad management practices eat into the nationâ€™s wealth, channelling money away from such projects and
    the very people most dependent on government for support.</p>
  <p>Countless studies around the world show how corruption can interrupt investment, restrict trade, reduce economic growth
    and distort the facts and figures associated with government expenditure. But the most alarming studies are the ones
    directly linking corruption in certain countries to increasing levels of poverty and income inequality.</p>
  <p>Because corruption creates fiscal distortions and redirects money allocated to income grants, eligibility for housing
    or pensions and weakens service delivery, it is usually the poor who suffer most. Income inequality has increased
    in most countries experiencing high levels of corruption.</p>
  <p>To tackle corruption in Africa, we must all play our part. </p>  
  <p>SAY NO TO CORRUPTION!!!</p>
